# Dora The Explorer.
The purpose of creating this repository was to learn and practice how to write more of Git Commands and also practice how to use Git commands efficiently without forgetting to have Fun.
I really enjoyed playing my own adventure (yes it's very nice) so I figure that many of you would like it too. Thank you for those who tried out my "Dora the explorer" adventure and special thank you to those who liked it.
